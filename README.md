### What is floatr?
floatr is a student-made social platform made by Harvard-Westlake students for students of HW. Our mission is to create student-driven communities that are safe spaces for all without school affiliation.

<br />

### Students First
As students ourselves, we designed the platform to be student driven. Each school community will be maintained by student administrators to foster a private and positive environment.
